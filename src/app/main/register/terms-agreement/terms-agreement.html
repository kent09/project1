                <p><br>
                The platform enables the Buyer to post offers for purchase of Cryptocurrency, and enables the Seller to post offers for sale of Cryptocurrency. The price at which said offer is made to buy or sell Cryptocurrency shall be quoted by the user at his/her own discretion. The Participants acknowledge that their offers should be submitted only after careful consideration, and offers, once submitted by the user, shall be recognized as available for sale or purchase transactions of Cryptocurrency executed by other users. The Seller and the Buyer agree that as soon as their offers match, a transaction is binding and can not be recalled. A transaction for a purchase of Cryptocurrency shall be completed instantly and without notice to the Seller and the Buyer, and will be treated as effected as of the moment it was actually executed.<br>
                <br>
                Acting as the Buyer or the Seller in a transaction for sale and purchase of Cryptocurrency, the participants recognize that they lose the right to cancel the application after the match of prices and automatic transaction execution.<br>
                When the buyer’s and the seller’s offers match, the Service shall gain the exclusive right to execute the transaction in the amount equal to the price specified in the transaction, net of commission fee.<br>
                <br>
                &nbsp;</p>
                <p>RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE SERVICE</p>
                <p><br>
                The Users acknowledge and agree that in effecting transactions they trade with other users, and acknowledge that the Service shall only act as an intermediary</p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p>in such transactions, rather than a contractor. Thus, users bear the responsibility to comply with all laws and regulations related to the transactions.<br>
                <br>
                The Service represents and warrants that:<br>
                1. It will use all reasonable efforts to facilitate and ensure the transactions be effected between users.<br>
                2. All sales-purchase transactions effected on the Platform will be posted anonymously, i.e. so that the Buyers and Sellers remain unknown to each other.<br>
                3. A transaction price will be calculated based on the actual relevant offers made by the users and shall include the applicable commission fees.<br>
                4. As soon as specific offers for sale and purchase of Cryptocurrency match, such offers may not be recalled.<br>
                5. All amounts and all Cryptocurrency deposited by the User into the User’s account shall be stored by the Service on its behalf, in accordance with the data specified in the profile.<br>
                6. All laws and regulations related to the offered Platform shall be complied with.<br>
                <br>
                If a user is in breach of these Terms the Service the Platform reserves the right to suspend the User’s account and block all funds therein, including Cryptocurrency.<br>
                <br>
                The Platform is not intended to provide any legal, tax, insurance or investment advice. The history of applications (bids) and tenders is solely for the purpose of providing users with general information related to transactions previously executed on the Platform, and should not be considered as investment advice or advice from the Service. Users are solely responsible for determining the fact that a contemplated transaction is appropriate for them based on their personal objectives, financial position and affordable risks.<br>
                <br>
                The service doesn't take responsibility for sustained casualties due to vulnerability of software, blockchains or any other technical features of cryptocurrency trading on the website. Likewise it's not responsible for the casualties due to late report by cryptocurrency developers or representatives (or no report at all) of any issues with cryptocurrency including all sorts of forks, technical node issues or any other issues having fund losses as a result. In this case there are two ways to refund the losses. The priority option the service is struggling to actualize is having particular cryptocurrency developers or</p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p>representatives to refund losses fully. The other option is to charge clients' accounts in accordance with their deposit amounts of this specific cryptocurrency.<br>
                <br>
                &nbsp;</p>
                <p>RESPONSIBILITIES OF USERS</p>

                The Seller warrants that Cryptocurrency (s) offered for sale or transfer, corresponds to the actual Bitcoin(s), SuperiorCoin(s), or unit(s) of other relevant Cryptocurrency.<br>
                 <br>
                The Buyer warrants that the currency used to buy Cryptocurrency corresponds to the Buyer’s actual assets and arrives from legal sources.<br>
                <br>
                The users agree that they will not use the platform to carry out any illegal activities, including, but not limited to money laundering, terrorist financing or deliberately engage in activities designed to adversely effect the performance of the Platform.<br>
                <br>
                If you need more than several hundred of opened orders, please contact support to clarify the reasons.<br>
                <br>
                Opened orders which are absolutely out of market (over 100 times out of market price) can be canceled by support in case of big amount of such orders for one client. Such orders are considered as dust orders. For example BTC/SCS buy orders with .0000001BTC price will be canceled if you have a lot of such orders.<br>
                <br>
                The users agree that, whenever the transaction is effected, the Platform sends and receives amounts of Cryptocurrency (s) on behalf of the Purchaser and on behalf of the Seller, through the IT systems used by the Platform at the time of the transaction's execution.<br>
                <br>
                Clients guarantee not to disclose any information obtained during</p>
